Visualizing daily raining in Caracas

# The idea
Every raining season in Caracas there are countless tragedies and troubles in the city.
Everyone start talking about the rain: because of the rain this, because of the rain that, brainlessly blaming the rain for everything.
I wanted to show that is not the rain. It's just the lack of planning.
After asking to the [Inameh](http://www.inameh.gob.ve) for the daily raining data over Caracas and after waiting for it for more than a week.
I put this project on hold until now.
The result is not spectacular but considering that the data they sent was complete only for three years, you can clearly see that there has been less rain each year.
You can also see that the dry season -at the begining of the year- has lasted longer for 2012 and 2013.
